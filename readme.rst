Arm Reference Platforms
=======================

Introduction
------------

Arm produce open source software stacks for a variety of platforms, serving as a
reference to help enable product development based on Arm IP for a range of
target markets and applications.

We use these software stacks to demonstrate:

- Integration of multiple open source software components, including firmware,
  operating systems, applications, and services

- Upstream support for configuring the latest Arm IP

- Software features including secure boot, secure services, power management,
  and reliability/availablility/serviceability (RAS) error handling

- Alignment with Arm specifications and open source community initiatives


Software stacks
---------------

For Armv8-A platforms we provide integrated Linux and Android software stacks.

Mobile segment platforms include:

- SCP-firmware
- Trusted Firmware-A
- OP-TEE
- U-Boot port
- Android Common Kernel (ACK)
- Android Open Source Project (AOSP) based distribution with graphics support
- Yocto build and packaging using Poky filesystem for Total Compute(TC0) platform

Infrastructure segment platforms include:

- SCP-firmware
- Trusted Firmware-A
- EDK II UEFI port
- GRUB loaded distro such as Fedora Enterprise
- Booting multiple instances of a guest OS using Linux KVM & kvmtool is also
  supported

Rich IoT segment platforms include:

- Boot-firmware
- Trusted Firmware-A
- Mainline Linux kernel
- Yocto build and packaging using poky tiny filesystem

All platforms also support a basic Linux boot to a BusyBox ramdisk filesystem.

These software stacks are updated and tested as part of a quarterly release and
are made available to build from source, with prebuilt binaries also being
available for a limited subset of configurations.
